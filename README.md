# [Data Science Portfolio](https://a00447694.github.io/)
Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository contains projects and experiments that showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Each project has its own markdown file that provides a detailed walkthrough of the project, the data sources used, the methods applied, and the main insights or conclusions.

## Projects
Here's a list of the projects included in this portfolio:

### 1. Assessing Campaign Performance Using Chi-Square Test For Independence: 
In this project, I use the chi-square test for independence to assess the performance of a marketing campaign. The data used is a public dataset from a retail company.

### 2. Understanding Alcohol Product Relationships Using Association Rule Learning: 
In this project, I use association rule learning to understand the relationships between different types of alcohol products. The data used is a public dataset from a liquor store.

### 3. Compressing Feature Space For Classification Using PCA: 
In this project, I use principal component analysis (PCA) to compress the feature space of a classification problem. The data used is a public dataset for Ed Sheeran's latest music albums.

### 4. The "You Are What You Eat" Customer Segmentation: 
In this project, I perform customer segmentation based on their food purchasing / eating habits. The data used is a public dataset from a grocery store.

### 5. Enhancing Targeting Accuracy Using ML: 
In this project, I use various machine learning models to enhance the targeting accuracy of a marketing campaign. The data used is a public dataset from a retail company.

### 6. Predicting Customer Loyalty Using ML: 
In this project, I use machine learning models, particularly regression techniques to predict customer loyalty based on their purchasing history. The data used is a public dataset from a retail company.
